# Final-Project

So, I will admit, I could've tried harder. I just got it stuck in my head that I'm no good at this, and why bother trying. Yeah, it frustrates me 'cause now I'm probably going to
fail the class, and have my parents get all on my case about it. However, I did enjoy the time I spent in class and I enjoyed attmepting the learning process. Please don't think
of this as me trying to butter you up, because I know better than anyone right now that there's no talking my way out of this. I just wanted to apologize for being worthless, but
I also wanted to thank you for putting up with me and being such a fun, funny and nice teacher. I hope you have a good summer, and I am sorry agian for turning in a piece of garbage.
